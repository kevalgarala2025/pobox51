                <p class="text-body mb-3">PoBox51 started with a lightbulb moment in the middle of a chaotic Indian airport. Picture this: a group of tech pros, including our founder Sameer, all trying to swap contact details before heading to the CeBIT event. It was like a comedy of errors—repeating names, double-checking numbers, and hoping no one misheard an email address over the airport's blaring announcements.</p>
                <p class="text-body mb-3">As Sameer took a breather with a cup of masala tea, he couldn’t help but think, "There’s got to be a better way." Whether you’re at a business conference, a casual meet-up, or even a Zumba class, the struggle to share contact info in a group setting is all too real. That’s when the idea for Pobox51 clicked—because who needs the hassle?</p>
                <p class="text-body mb-3"><b>“A simple utility for seamlessly exchanging contact information in a group setting.”</b></p>
                <p class="text-body mb-3">We named it Pobox51, tipping our hat to Area 51. When it comes to privacy and security, we believe in going above and beyond. We know the last thing you want is your contact info floating around the internet or being snagged by spammers. So, here’s the deal: we don’t keep any of your data. Once the contacts are shared, everything is deleted—no snooping, no strings attached.</p>
                <p class="text-body mb-3">At Pobox51, we’re all about making connections simple, secure, and a little bit fun—just the way it should be.</p>
